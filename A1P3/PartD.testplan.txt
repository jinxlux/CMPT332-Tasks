We found that makefile of xv6 make the system run with 3 CPUs. So we divide
our test into 2 parts:
1. test with 3 CPUs
2. test with 1 CPU by altering the makefile document

In test_numprocs.c, we change the value of n to create different 
processes once each time.
For example, when n = 5, there should be 5 processes running.
Thus, we can change the value of n to test our program more times.

For the first part, we test with 3 CPUs. 
We test with n = 12, 5, 20 separately.
Start the program by "make qemu, type "test_numprocs" to run the test with n=12;
When get result, quit, make clean, and we change the n-value in test_numprocs.c,
repeat above steps.
When n = 12, 2 processes will stuck in the 2 CPU, so we should only
have "Have 10 RUNNABLE" printed out
When n = 5, 2 processes will stuck in the 2 CPU, so we should only
have "Have 3 RUNNABLE" printed out
When n = 20, 2 processes will stuck in the 2 CPU, so we should only
have "Have 18 RUNNABLE" printed out

For the second part, we test with only 1 CPU by change makefile of xv6. 
We test with n = 12, 5, 20 separately.
When n = 12, we should have "Have 12 RUNNABLE" printed out
When n = 5,  we should have "Have 5 RUNNABLE" printed out
When n = 20, we should have "Have 20 RUNNABLE" printed out
