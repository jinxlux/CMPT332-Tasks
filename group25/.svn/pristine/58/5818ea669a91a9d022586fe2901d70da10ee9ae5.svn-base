For partE, we first run our program. The current working directory 
should be displayed, and we can continue enter command on our
shell. We prepare some typical commands for testing out shell:
cd ..
cd file
cd /usr/bin
cd fileNotExist
ls
whereis ls
ls file
cat makefile | wc -l
asdea  
exit

cd and exit commands are for testing our built-in commands.
For cd, we will gave relative, absolute and error path.
These commands should give us same result as we do in the bash shell.
asdea is an arbitrary error command, so we should have the
error message as we have in the bash shell.
Other commands, Pipeline should all give us same results 
as we use them on the bash shell.
