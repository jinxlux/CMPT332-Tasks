Pseudocode for monitors with semaphores.
Lab 5 CMPT 332 
Fall 2018

Global data:
semaphores for enterQ, urgentQ, and mutex.
semaphores for each condition variable.
global variable to indicate if monitor occupied.
Lists for each CV and an enterQ and an urgentQ

MonEnter()
  acquire(mutex)
  if the monitor is occupied then add to waiting queue, release mutex 
     and wait on enterSem
  else set monBusy to true and release mutex

MonLeave()
  acquire mutex
  if urgentq not empty, take item off urgentq, V the urgentq and release
  the mutex
  else if enterq not empty, take item off emptyq, V the emptyq and release
  the mutex
  else monBusy to false and  release mutex

MonWait (int cv)
  acquire mutex
  add to waiting list
  if urgentq not empty, take item off urgentq, V the urgentq
  else if enterq not empty, take item off emptyq, V the emptyq
  else set monBusy to false

  release the mutex
  wait on the semaphore for the CV

MonSignal(int cv)
  acquire mutex
  if there is non-empty cvlist,  take first item off the CVlist, add
     myself to the urgentq, release mutex, wakeup the first item on
     CVlist, block on the urgentQ
  else
     release mutex

MonInit

  create semaphores and lists;
