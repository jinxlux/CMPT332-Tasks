For partE, we first run our shell program. After make, you could enter 
./partE to run our shell. The current working directory should be displayed,
and we can continue enter command on our shell. 
We prepare some typical commands for testing out shell:
cd ..
cd file
cd /usr/bin
cd ~
cd fileNotExist
ls
ls -al
ps
whereis ls
which ls
ls file
ps aux | wc -l
cat Makefile | wc -l
ls -l | head -3
asdea  
exit

cd and exit commands are for testing our built-in commands.
For cd, we will gave relative, absolute and error path.
These commands should give us same result as we do in the bash shell.
asdea is an arbitrary error command, so we should have the
error message as we have in the bash shell.
Other commands, Pipeline should all give us same results 
as we use them on the bash shell.
ps and ps aux | wc -l may give us different results from our shell and bash shell 
because the number of running process changed when we run our program, and
other new processes may appear during this time

we will test 'exit' function, but we can not paste any result to the result
file because exit just close the whole terminal.
