At first, This part we have 4 different version(A1 and A2 are mandatory, 
A3 and A4 are bonus). 

As a result, we should have a "square" function and it should work with all 
4 version of partA. 
This function is a recursion function, which will return the square of its argument. 
Besides that, we should get the current thread id, utilize the threadInfo 
pointer to update the square count. Square function should looks like that:
int Square(int number){
    details
    
}
In order to get the current thread id in square function, 
we should have a "getID" function.
This function is different for differnt parts It should looks like
that:
int getID(){
    details
}

Above are the general things for all 4 version of partA.

For PartA1, we want to run in Windows system and we should initialize 
a boolean golbal variable named keepRunning as TRUE to let 
program keep running. We have three arguments, childrenNumber, deadLine and sizeNumber.
Write a loop which will execute childrenNumber times to create childrenNumber child.
childrenNumber is the first argument and how many child thread we have to create. 
which represents the number of child threads.
We need to use the CreateThread() function to create 
a child thread each time the loop executed. 
CreateThread() has six parameter.
CreateThread(default security attributes,
	     default stack size,
	     thread function named ThreadFunction() which contains square(),
	     argument to thread function the size n let square() calculate,
	     creation flags
	     return thread identifier)
After that we should use sleep() function let parent thread sleep.
Its sleep time should be the second of main deadLine.
If the parent suspend time over (deadline) before all children completed, 
the program will assign keepRunning false, and then suspend children threads. 
Otherwise children threads will keep running until they are completed.
No matter whether they are completed, they will provide the information: 
	1. When the child thread began
    2. When the child thread finished
	2. how many times, the square() procedure is called, from the start to the end 
        (finish the calculation or be interrupted due to deadline)
As a result, inside the thread function ThreadFunction(), we should use
GetSystemTime() and Square()
