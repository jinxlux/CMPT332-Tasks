In proc.c, we mainly implement thread_create, thread_join, 
mtx_create, mtx_lock and mtx_unlock.

For implementing the thread_create, we first allocate process
to the new thread by allocproc(). We got the parent process by calling
myproc(); Since our new thread share the address space with it's parent, 
we just simply assign it's parent's pagetable to the new thread:
np->pagetable = p->pagetable; (np is pointer to the new thread, p is pointer
to the parent process). New thread should have the same size as it's 
parent, so we let np->sz = p->sz. Then, we set new thread's parent by
np->parent = p. After that, We copy saved user registers, 
cause thread_create to return 0 in the child. 
We need to use uvmmap to copy the trap frame information to the new
thread, then we set ra(returned address), sp(stack pointer), 
epc(program counter) of new thread's trap frame. Incrementing reference 
counts on open file descriptors, setting new thread's name, state, 
lock are all same as fork(). Finally, we return np->pid.

For implementing the thread_join, we first need to hold p->lock for the 
whole time to avoid lost wakeups from a child's exit(). Then, we use
a for-loop to continuely scan through table looking for exited children.
We check whether the scanned thread is the child by checking its parent
and pagetable: if(np->parent == p && np->pagetable == p->pagetable).
We uses np->parent without holding np->lock. 
acquiring the lock first would cause a deadlock,
since np might be an ancestor, and we already hold p->lock.
np->parent can't change between the check and the acquire() because only 
the parent changes it, and we're the parent.
If we found the thread is the child, we need to check whether it is terminated
by checking its state: if(np->state == ZOMBIE). If it is true, it means we
find one, and we need to free it, release it's lock, unmaps its trap frame 
by uvmunmaptf, release parent's lock and place a pointer to its stack in stack.
We then turn it's pid. 
If we cannot find any children threads after all, we just release parent's 
lock and return -1.
Finally, we Wait for a child to exit.

For implementing the mtx_create, we first need to add an array in the proc.c 
to save the spinlock created, and we need an lock ID to indicate which 
spinlock is created/locked/unlocked.
In int mtx_create(int locked), we just initialize a lock at the
lockID position in the array by the value of locked given:
initlock(&locks[lockID],"lock")
locks[lockID]->locked = locked
Then, we save the current ID, and we should add lockID by one for the future
mutex lock created.
Finally we return the current lock ID.
If lockID is bigger than the size of the array, we just return -1 to show
the failure of creating the new mutex.

For implementing int mtx_lock(int lock_id), we first check whether the
lock_id is legal. If it's not, we return -1.
Then, we should use the lock_id to get the spinlock in the array, 
and we use acquire(struct spinlock *lk) 
to acquire the lock. Thread should be blocked here if the mutex's locked
is 1(true). It will not be blocked if locked is 0(false), and acquire 
will reset the locked to 1 to block the next thread call this routine by 
using __sync_lock_test_and_set.
If everything works well, it should return 0; it will return -1 
otherwise.

For implementing int mtx_unlock(int lock_id), we first check whether the
lock_id is legal. If it's not, we return -1.
Then, we should use the lock_id to get the spinlock in the array, 
and we use release(struct spinlock *lk)
to release the lock. (lk->locked should be 0 after) 
If everything works well, it should return 0; it will return -1 
otherwise.
