I like the title "Multiple Targets in a Rule" which clearly 
tell me what this document will do. I also like the cases 
and examples given. I dislike the description of variable 
"â€˜$@â€™" in the document, and I still do not know what
characters like "â€˜" stand for.
The goal, prerequisites, the advantage of
using automatic variable and the way to run code is clear.
