The thing I like:
    1. It has a title to show what the codes for and tell me the structure
    of the code at the begining.
    2. It gives me some code examples to show me how does the program run.
    3. It tells me the things need to be attention when I run the code.
The thing I don't like:
    1. Its variable name is really bad. Variable name should be more reasonable

For this document, the description, prerequisites, things need to be attention
and the way to run the code is clear. I think it unfairly assumed that user would like to vary 
the prerequisites according to the target.
