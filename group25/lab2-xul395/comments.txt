I like the title "Multiple Targets in a Rule" which clearly 
tell me what this document will do. I also like the cases 
and examples given. I dislike the description of variable 
"â€˜$@â€™" in the document, and I still do not know what
characters like "â€˜" stand for. 
The goal, cases of using the rule, and the advantage of
using automatic variable are clear.
I think it unfairly assumed that reader will know terms like
"prerequisites", "recipe", and reader need to vary prerequisites
a lot.
