<h4 id="MTiaR">Multiple Targets in a Rule</h4>
   <p>This is useful in two cases.

   You want just prerequisites, no recipe.

   Similar recipes work for all the targets. The recipes do not need to be
   absolutely identical, since the automatic variable ‘$@’ can be used to
   substitute the particular target to be remade into the commands (see
   Automatic Variables). For example:
   <br>
   <br>
   <code>
   bigoutput littleoutput : text.g
   <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) > $@
   </code>
   <br>
   <br>
   is equivalent to
   <br>
   <br>
   <code>
   bigoutput : text.g
   <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generate text.g -big > bigoutput
   <br>
   <br>
   littleoutput : text.g
   <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generate text.g -little > littleoutput
   </code>
   <br>
   <br>
   Suppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the target,
   much as the variable ‘$@’ allows you to vary the recipe. You cannot do this
   with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you can do it with a static
   pattern rule.</p>
