For partB, we did philosopher part.

We just run the read reader-writer-test,
informations like:
go to proc xx;
ServerPid: xx;
successfully receive xx reply;
receive msg from xx;
add xx to xx list;
release xx from xx list;
etc
(xx above are routines' names or lists' names
This is white box test, these informatios is only for testing.
So only informations in reader-writer.c and reader-writer-monitor.c will keep after testing
)

we run philosopher, information will print out same as above;
also informations like:
Pholosopher eating
Pholosopher thinking
Pholosopher finish eating 
etc.
will print out, and these informations will keep (otherwise nothing will print)
