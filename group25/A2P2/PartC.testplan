For testing the code, we have many conditions:

1.
do not give any port number & machine name:
messages like:
usage: yourPort hostMachine hostPort
Argument(s) is/are null
shoule be popped out

2.
give unappropriate port numbers & machine name :
messges like:
machine port number wrong
should be printed out

3.
Use 2 machines & ports, using 2 terminals
give appropriate port numbers & machine name :
successful message should be printed out,
messages like:
"unblock the stdin"
"unblcok the socker" 
"ready to receive"
"ready to send"
"ready to print"
.etc
should be printed out
(just for white test: to show routines are well used.
Features will be turned off after testing)

After typing messages in from 1 terminal and press "Enter",
the messages should immediately show on both terminals in 2 machines.
Imformations like:
"showList used in xx"
"sendList used in xx"
"receive info successfully"
"send info successfully"
.etc 
should be printed out
(again, for white testing out. This printed information be not be shown
after testing)

Keep typing more messages to test.
