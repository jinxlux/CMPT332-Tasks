We finished most parts of this chat program.
We finished keyboardThread() to get message from user,
printToScreen() to print the message to screen. Also we finished some
of the sendOverNetwork() and receiveNetworkMsg(). We have some test results showed below:

// wrong port
tow087@tux7:~/cmpt332assignment/group25/A2P2> ./s-chat 30001 peon34 39001
mainp function need to be 
Could not find host name: peon34

// no args: just stop
xul395@tux6:~/cmpt332A1/group25/A2P2> ./s-chat 
usage: yourPort hostMachine hostPort
EX: 30001 tux1 40000
Argument(s) is/are null

//
sorry, we did not have much time to test the appropriate condition
